I am an Assistant Professor in the Civil Engineering department of <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/pranamesh-chakraborty" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>. I also hold an Adjunct Faculty position in the Kotak School of Sustainability at IIT Kanpur.


My research focuses on applying deep-learning-based computer vision techniques, reinforcement learning for vehicle control, and driver behavior understanding in real-world and simulated traffic conditions. 


I finsihed my PhD from <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a> in 2019 working with <a href="https://www.ccee.iastate.edu/directory/?user_page=anujs" target="_blank">Dr. Anuj Sharma</a> & <a href="http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/" target="_blank">Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a>. My Masters degree was from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a> working with <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~partha/" target="_blank">Dr. Partha Chakroborty</a> and my Bachelors degree from <a href="http://www.iiests.ac.in/" target="_blank">BESU, Shibpur</a> (present IIEST, Shibpur).

**(New) Positions available:** I am looking for PhD and PostDoc candidates with a strong academic background interested in working on exciting problems related to machine learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and driver behavior understanding (driving simulator and real-world conditions). Candidates with only a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering, having an excellent academic record, can also apply for a PhD degree.

I am looking for undergraduate students interested in doing B. Tech projects related to simulated traffic scene generation (using Unity).
