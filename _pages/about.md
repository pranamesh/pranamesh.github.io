I am a PhD student in the Civil Engineering department of Iowa State University working with [Dr. Anuj Sharma](https://www.ccee.iastate.edu/directory/?user_page=anujs) and [Dr. Chinmay Hegde](http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/). Presently, I am working as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow in the [Institute of Transportation](https://intrans.iastate.edu/), Iowa State University.  My research focusses on applying deep-learning based computer vision techniques and large-scale data analytics for solving transportation engineering problems. 

I finsihed my Masters from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2014 working with [Dr. Partha Chakroborty](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~partha/) and my Bachelors from [BESU, Shibpur](http://www.iiests.ac.in/) (present IIEST, Shibpur) in 2012.
