I am an Assistant Professor in the Civil Engineering department of <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/pranamesh-chakraborty" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a>. 


My research focusses on applying deep-learning based computer vision techniques and large-scale data analytics for solving transportation engineering problems. 


I finsihed my PhD from <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a> in 2019 working with <a href="https://www.ccee.iastate.edu/directory/?user_page=anujs" target="_blank">Dr. Anuj Sharma</a> & <a href="http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/" target="_blank">Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a>. My Masters degree was from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a> working with <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~partha/" target="_blank">Dr. Partha Chakroborty</a> and my Bachelors degree from <a href="http://www.iiests.ac.in/" target="_blank">BESU, Shibpur</a> (present IIEST, Shibpur).

**PhD positions available:**  I am looking for motivated students with strong academic background intererested to work on exciting real-world intelligent transportation systems problems related to machine learning, computer vision, and large-scale data anlaytics. Interested students can apply from the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/ce/pg-admissions" target="_blank">IITK CE PG admission</a>. Candidates with only Bachelorâ€™s degree in Civil Engineering having an excellent academic record can also apply.
